# Lightning Lib

An implementation of [Lightning contracts](https://github.com/BaptisteContreras/lightning-contracts)


This library provides a bridge to use [Swoole](https://www.swoole.co.uk/) with Symfony and it tries to simplify the use of Swoole concurrency.

It's recommended to use it with the [Lightning Symfony bundle](https://github.com/BaptisteContreras/lightning-bundle).



## Installation

```
 composer require sflightning/lib
```
